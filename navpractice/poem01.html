     <p><strong>Ghost House</strong></p>
     <p>Robert Frost</p>
     <p>I dwell in a lonely house I know<br>
      That vanished many a summer ago,<br>
   And left no trace but the cellar walls,<br>
   And a cellar in which the daylight falls<br>
And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow.<br>
</p>

<p>O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield<br>
The woods come back to the mowing field;<br>
   The orchard tree has grown one copse<br>
   Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops;<br>
The footpath down to the well is healed.<br>
</p>

<p>I dwell with a strangely aching heart<br>
In that vanished abode there far apart<br>
   On that disused and forgotten road<br>
   That has no dust-bath now for the toad.<br>
Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart;<br>
</p>
<p>The whippoorwill is coming to shout<br>
And hush and cluck and flutter about:<br>
   I hear him begin far enough away<br>
   Full many a time to say his say<br>
Before he arrives to say it out.<br>
</p>
<p>It is under the small, dim, summer star.<br>
I know not who these mute folk are<br>
   Who share the unlit place with me—<br>
   Those stones out under the low-limbed tree<br>
Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar.<br>
</p>
<p>They are tireless folk, but slow and sad—<br>
Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,—<br>
   With none among them that ever sings,<br>
   And yet, in view of how many things,<br>
As sweet companions as might be had.<br>
